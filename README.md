# JavaScript Crash Course

This repository is meant to teach the essential language features of JavaScript by developing a mock chat application from scratch - no libraries, except Jasmine (assuming your browser supports all ES2015 features).

### Major concepts include:

* Object oriented features (classes, inheritance, etc.)
* Variable declarations (let and const)
* Arrow functions
* Template strings
* Promises
* Maps and sets
* Default, rest, and spread

### How does this crash course work?

1. Clone the directory
2. Navigate to the `/src` directory and copy the full path of the `src/index.html` file into your browser
3. Notice that Jasmine unit tests are being run, but they're all failing
4. Fill out the code in `/src/js` so that the unit tests pass
5. Reference the `/ref/js` directory if you get stuck
