# JavaScript Crash Course

This repository is meant to teach the essential language features of JavaScript by developing a mock chat application from scratch - no libraries (assuming your browser supports all ES2015 features).

Major concepts include:

* Object oriented features (classes, inheritance, etc.)
* Variable declarations (let and const)
* Arrow functions
* Template strings
* Modules
* Promises
* Maps and sets
* Default, rest, and spread
